          Believe it or not, community running groups are more than just a gathering of sweaty people. They are a place where like-minded individuals can find and offer support as they share their experiences and grow as people. Running is a great way to improve physical and mental health and wellbeing, and these benefits often increase when the participant is involved in a group or club setting.

          <h3>Mental Benefits of Running</h3>

            Running has been shown to have numerous mental health benefits. It can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve self-esteem and confidence. Running also releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosting chemicals that can help you feel more positive and energized.
            <br/>
            Being part of a community running group can amplify these benefits. Running with others can provide a sense of camaraderie and social support. When you are part of a group, you can push each other to reach new goals, celebrate each otherâ€™s successes, and provide encouragement when things get tough.
            <br/>

          <h3>Physical Benefits of Running</h3>

            Running is also an excellent way to improve physical health (duh). It can help increase cardiovascular fitness, strengthen bones and muscles, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Running can also help with weight loss and management.
            <br/>
            Joining a community running group can help you take your physical health to the next level. You can train with others who have similar goals, and challenge each other to improve your fitness. Having a group to train with can also help you stay on top of your metrics and motivated to stick to your training plan.
            <br/>

          <h3>Training and Racing with Others</h3>

            Clubs provide a supportive environment for both training and racing. Training with others can help you stay motivated and accountable, and provide valuable feedback and support. Running with others can also just be really fun and, with the right kind folks, really silly.
            <br/>
            Participating in a race is an amazing feeling and much different than just your morning run. Rraces can provide a sense of accomplishment and help you set and acheive new personal records (PR). Racing with your established running community can also provide a sense of belonging and shared experience.
            <br/>

          <h3>Overall Health and Wellbeing</h3>

            Being part of a running group or club can have a significant impact on overall health and wellbeing. The social support and sense of belonging can improve mental health, while the physical benefits of running can improve physical health. Training and racing with others can help you reach new levels that help you understand what accomplishment really means.
            <br/>
            So, in general, running groups are more than just a place to run. They are a place to connect with your local or extended community, make new friends, set new goals (and be accountable for them!), and improve overall health. Whether you are a seasoned runner or just starting out, send us an email and get connected with your local trails and fellow endorphin-nuts!
